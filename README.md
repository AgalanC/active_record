# Object Oriented Ruby Challenges

A number of object-oriented coding challenges with tests lovingly borrowed from
the [Exercism.io Ruby Track](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

If you enjoy these please consider signing up for
[exercism.io](http://exercism.io) and submitting your versions of the
challenges.

## Test Driver Development

*Quoting Exercism:*

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Exercism simulates [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved the problem.

The tests are written using [Mini Test](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)
a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and
benchmarking.
