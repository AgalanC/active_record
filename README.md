# Object Oriented Ruby Challenges

A number of object-oriented coding challenges with tests lovingly borrowed from
the [Exercism.io Ruby Track](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

If you enjoy these please consider signing up for
[exercism.io](http://exercism.io) and submitting your versions of the
challenges.

## Fetching and Running the Challenges

To being you will need to clone this repository from the command prompt. The
folder you are in when you run the clone command will be where the files end up.

    git clone https://github.com/StungEye-RRC/OO-Ruby-Challenges.git

To run the tests for the first challenge:

    cd OO-Ruby-Challenges\01-hello-world
    ruby ruby hello_world_test.rb

As your instructor adds more challenges to the repo you can update your clone.
Run the following from the repository's root folder:

    git pull

## Test Driven Development

*Quoting Exercism:*

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Exercism simulates [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved the problem.

The tests are written using [Mini Test](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)
a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and
benchmarking.
